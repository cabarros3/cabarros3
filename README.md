## Hello, World! :nerd_face:

Greetings! I'm Camilla Barros and I'm mostly a librarian, but sometimes I'm a dev too. My favorite languages are python and javascript. If you're pay attention you will know that I'm in love with web develop. This is it. Let's rock and code :metal:.

You can always talk to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/camillabarros/).
